= Audio / Video support =
Currently most of the Audio functionality is not implemented / does nothing so we can run more programs. We will probably need to include a lib to do decoding of video/audio for us.

libavcodec/ffmpeg looks like our best bet. It seems to have Atrac3 decoding, and it definately has MP3/WMA/H263/H264 support.

== sceNet/Inet/Apctl/Resolver ==

danzel is working on these, most can be directly mapped to c# functions.

The resolver/simple samples in the SDK are good test targets, don't forget to disable #define printf pspDebugScreenPrintf.
