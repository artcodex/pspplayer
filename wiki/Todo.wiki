= TODO =
The following are items on my TODO list. Just because something isn't on here doesn't mean I won't do it; I either forgot about it or it's probably under [WouldBeCool] (where I imply that I want you to do it :). See [KnownIssues] for workarounds or other information regarding problems with the current code.

== Short-term ==
 * VFPU support in the Ultra CPU
 * Fix cleanup code so no need for a reset between runs (and it doesn't crash :)
 * Debug console (instead of outputting debug with Debug.WriteLine/etc)
 * Texture caching (in progress)
 * Figure out why the emulator sits idle so much
 * "New User Experience" - automatically pick the best plugins and set them up

== Long-term ==
 * Build a site/database of unimplemented BIOS routines and playable games
  * This is about half done - I had to do a project for a class and used this. The player can submit game information to the service and it will be displayed to users. Need to finish it up one day!
